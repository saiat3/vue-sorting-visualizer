# Sorting Visualizer

This small application, which is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), gives us the ability to visualize and play around with different
sorting algorithms. Building following application helped me to dive deeper and understand sorting algorithms better. Feel free to
check the visualizer [here](https://saiat3.github.io/vue-sorting-visualizer/).

Algorithms used:

- Bubble sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
